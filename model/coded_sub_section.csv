(a) 
be endorsed by DoI Water and then approved by the Secretary prior to carrying out any

(b) 
establish baseline conditions including but not limited to: 
(i) 
characterisation of the groundwater and aquifers on and around the site including but not limited 
to: 
• 
quality levels and flow directions and changes associated with climatic conditions; 
• 
identification of the boundaries and permeability of the alluvium associated with Glennies 
Creek and other potentially permeable geology such as the Permian coal measures; 
(ii) 
identification and characterisation of any Groundwater Dependent Ecosystems; 
(c) 
establish the detailed ongoing monitoring program including mechanisms for review of the program 
and incorporation of monitoring results into the Groundwater Management Plan required under 
 condition 38(d) of Schedule 3 and the Surface and Groundwater Response Plan required under 
condition 38(e) of Schedule 3.; 
(d) 
provide for validation and updating of the modelling predictions on a regular basis and incorporation 
of the results into the relevant plans in condition 38 of Schedule 3 and in any operational responses 
required to comply with condition 30 of Schedule 3. Where updated modelling predictions change 
the expected project outcomes the Proponent is required to ensure the impacts of the Project do not 
exceed those predicted in the EA or the Amended plans submitted to the Commission; and

provide for independent review of the adequacy of the groundwater verification monitoring program 
and modelling as part of the independent environmental audits required under condition 8 of 
Schedule 5 including provision for a copy of the results and any recommendations to be provided to 
DoI Water. 
The monitoring program required under sub-condition (c) is required to cover all pre during and post- mining 
operations. With regard to post-mining unless otherwise agreed by the Secretary in consultation with DoI 
Water the program should include a series of piezometers established in the backfill in a line within the 
central part of the site orientated in a north-south direction. The piezometers should be spaced equally apart 
and extend from the northern extent of the fill and then in a southerly direction to the edge of the final void. 
The purpose will be to monitor the rise over time of the recovering water table within the backfill to ensure 
that groundwater levels remain below the creek alluvium water table elevation and also to establish the 
overall gradient towards the final void to allow model validation 5 years after completion of the final landform 
and dewatering of the project. 
With regard to sub-condition (d) unless otherwise agreed by the Secretary in consultation with DoI Water 
the validation and updating of the modelling predictions should be conducted 2 years after mining 
commences and then again after an additional 5 years (i.e. a total of 7 years after mining commences) and 
5 years after completion of the final landform and dewatering of the project. Monitoring should continue at 
least 10 years after completion of the final landform and dewatering of the project by the Proponent.

2012 the applicable Australian Standards (including AS 3798-2007) and the measures in Appendix 
7 regarding management of threats to the LPB; 
 
respond to the baseline conditions established in the Groundwater and Aquifer Verification and 
Monitoring Program in condition 34 above 
 
include detailed design construction and engineering specifications including but not limited to: 
(iii) materials construction methods detailed plans any staging contextual mapping including 
spatially and in relation to the surrounding geology and groundwater aquifers; 
(iv) detailed design of the surrounding works and infrastructure including the flood levee ROM 
facility and out of pit emplacement 
(v) 
detailed justification for the location specifications and positioning of the LPB particularly in 
relation to the length and positioning of the northern extension; 
(vi) the performance parameters of the design (including justification of the lifespan) demonstrating 
they maintain or improve on the parameters set out in the Amended plans submitted to the 
Commission the measures in Appendix 7 regarding management of threats to the LPB and the 
conditions in this approval; 
(vii) quality assurance and testing procedures relating to both the design and construction phases; 
 
demonstrate the LPB would remain effective over its lifespan and would withstand mining operations 
geological and weather events decay and corrosive attack - including biological attack; 
 
demonstrate that there would be no more than negligible seepage through or around the LPB in either 
direction over the life of the LPB; 
 
provide appropriate infrastructure and access arrangements for the ongoing monitoring maintenance 
and if necessary repair of the LPB throughout the mine life and post closure; 
 
be updated and resubmitted for approval in response to any issues arising from earlier stages of the 
construction.

maintained throughout the site regrading process and post closure.

The noise criteria do nol apply where the Proponent and the affected landowner have reached a negotiated
agreement in regard to noise and a copy of the agreement has been fonuarded to the Director-General and
EPA.
Noise from the project is to be measured at the most affecled point or within the residential boundary or at the
most affected point within 30 metres of a dwelling (rural situations) where the dwelling is more than 30 metres
from the boundary to determíne compliance with the LAeq(lo mtnuto) noíse limits in the above table. Where it can
be demonstrated that direct measurement of noise from the project is impractical the EPA may accept
alternative means of determining compliance (see Chapter 11 of the NSW tndustrial Norse Policy). The
modification factors in Secfion 4 of the NSW lndustrial Noise Policy shall atso be apptied to the measured noise
levels where applicable.
The noise ernlssion limits identified in the above table apply under meteorological conditions of:

Controlled Activities on Waterfront Land (DPI Water 2012)  
Clean water diversions 
and storage 
infrastructure 
• 
Design install and maintain the clean water system to capture and convey the 
100 year ARI flood 
• 
Maximise as far as reasonable the diversion of clean water around disturbed 
areas on the site except where clean water is captured for use on the site 
Sediment dams 
• 
Design install and/or maintain sediment dams to avoid off-site discharges to 
surface waters except as may be permitted under conditions B35 and B• 
Design install and maintain sediment dams in accordance with the guidance 
series Managing Urban Stormwater: Soils and Construction – Volume (Landcom 2004) and 2E Mines and Quarries (DECC 2008) and the 
requirements under the POEO Act or Protection of the Environment Operations 
(Hunter River Salinity Trading Scheme) Regulation Mine water storages 
• 
Design install and maintain mine water storage infrastructure to avoid 
unlicensed or uncontrolled discharge of mine water  
• 
Ensure adequate freeboards within all mine water storage dams and voids at all 
times to minimise the risk of discharge to surface waters 
• 
New on-site storages (including mine infrastructure dams groundwater storage 
and treatment dams) are suitably designed installed and maintained including 
being lined to comply with a permeability standard of < 1 x 10-9 m/s  
Brine management 
• 
Brine storage facilities are designed to store a 100 year ARI 72 hour storm event 
• 
Brine storage dama is suitably designed installed and maintained including 
being lined to comply with a permeability standard of < 1 x 10-9 m/s 
Reject management  
• 
Restrict any new emplacement of tailings and CHPP reject material to the East 
Void 
 
 Maxwell Underground Coal Mine Project 
 
(SSD 9526) 
Feature 
Performance Measure 
• 
Design and maintain tailings storage areas to prevent the movement of tailings 
seepage/leachate outside the Maxwell Infrastructure area 
• 
Manage CHPP reject material in a manner that is consistent with the document/s 
listed in condition A2(c) 
Overburden 
emplacements 
• 
Design install and maintain emplacements to encapsulate and prevent migration 
of acid forming and potentially acid forming materials and saline and sodic 
material 
• 
Design install and maintain emplacements to prevent and/or manage long term 
saline groundwater seepage 
Chemical and 
hydrocarbon storage 
• 
Chemical and hydrocarbon products to be stored in bunded areas in accordance 
with the relevant Australian Standard
