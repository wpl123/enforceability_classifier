## Background
Planning for “state significant” development proposals is a complex and contested space in  jurisdictions across Australia. The tension between planning systems focused on economic growth (reference) and environmental constraints (reference) at a local, national and global level are heightened each year.

In addition planning authorities must balance the states economic priorities with the competition for land and resources between stakeholders. Real or perceived conflicts of interest can challenge the States willingness to regulate both itself and the proponent's of state significant projects. 

Nowhere is this more evident than in the regulation of large projects that impact surface and groundwater in areas of developing climate risk such as the Murray Darling Basin.

## Problem Statement
State Significant Developments are approved by government authorities with complex approval conditions that are difficult to understand and difficult to enforce. Community stakeholders who seek to take legal action when approval conditions are breached are often unable to find legal grounds to seek redress. Remedies can be meaningless and penalties may lack teeth.

## Project Scope
The object of this study is to provide a comprehensive review of the groundwater approval conditions in NSW coal mine approval consents using content analysis and machine learning. In particular the project will:

    - Develop a classification model known as an “Enforceability Score” for groundwater conditions by identifying “enforceability” labels from a sample of approval consents

    - Apply the classification model to all other NSW coal mine planning consents groundwater conditions

    - Discuss the potential to apply the classification model to other consent conditions, or other planning consents in other jurisdictions
